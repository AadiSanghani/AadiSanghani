I’m Aadi, an IB alumni and second year Computer Science student @ McMaster University. I’m a software developer and currently completing my second year at university, while actively looking for different internship opportunities for 2023 Summer. I’m always interested to hear about any cool projects you’re working on!

### 🔭 I’m working on ...

- Currently in the planning phase of building my personal website which would have different projects that I have worked on/ working on

### 🌱 I’m learning ...
