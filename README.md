### Hi there 👋

I’m Aadi, an IB alumnus and third-year Computer Science student @ McMaster University. I’m a software developer currently completing my second year at university, and actively looking for different internship opportunities for 2024 Summer. I’m always interested in any cool projects you’re working on!

### 🔭 I’m working on ...

- Building an app that will auto-enroll me into the courses that I want
- Currently in the planning phase of building my personal website which would have different projects that I have worked on/ working on

### 🌱 I’m learning ...

- React and Tailwind CSS for personal website
- Learning AWS and NodeJS for the auto-enrollment app
